                    <p>I must feel important. I must tell myself a narrative at all times. I must weave meaning into everything that happens to and from me. I am not living my life on autopilot, no sir. That, is banal, bizarre and suboptimal. What is the purpose of my existence? I am pursuing quotidian satisfaction until altered by trauma, or pain or ephemeral epiphany.</p>
                    
                    <p>This ephemeral epiphany is ephemeral only to my mind, until I choose to latch onto this epiphany and deconstruct, desiccate and dedicate all my life to adhere to what that epiphany led me to believe. I do not understand why I must attach meaning to everything. Irony is that to understand, nay, completely perceive the reason for attaching meaning, I have to believe that the process of attaching ourselves to meaning is meaningful and not arbitrary. And so the plot thickens, I build a narrative on another narrative. The narrative makes sense, persuades and lulls the reader to believe in it!</p>
                    
                    <p>How do I get out of this travesty of trivial tribulations?</p>
                    
                    <p>I am not sure I can. I can barely put words together in a sentence before I lose amorphous thought from my mind leaving my mind as morose and mundane as a slow internet connection.</p>
                    
                    <p>So here's my morose, mundane, morbid mind - menacing enough in certain transient moments - but markedly mediocre when more murky words are associated with each other to form an alliteration. In fact, before writing this, my mind rejected 3 pieces of writing not because they lacked in meaning but they lacked in sharply and clearly expressing what I wanted to express. I believe in taking the reader through every emotion I am experiencing at any given ephemeral moment instead of something that's boring, but meaningful. So this time, l've written something completely opposite. This isn't a narrative, I am not trying to convince you of anything, I am just putting down my raw riveting reckonings here. Ofcourse, later I will dissect this from all possible angles and try to devise this into something more meaningful, because how could I write something that means nothing? It would make the reader feel like one feels after a one night stand - futile, forlorn, and devoid of meaning. I bet you expected alliteration in those adjectives? Touche.</p>
